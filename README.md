# Sentiment_Analysis_Binary
Sentiment Analysis of IMDB reviews using BERT model, Comet.ml for tracking and experimentation and Gradio for creating an interactive prototype.
## Problem and Approach
The goal is to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative, according to the sentiments expressed on text. To accomplish this, I applied a pre-trained BERT model fine tuned on the IMDB dataset for sentiment classification. 
  1. Comet.ml is integrated for tracking experiments, visualizing metrics and analyzing model performance.
  2. Gradio is used to build an interactive interface for users to input their reciews and in turn, get sentiment predictions.
